<p>For someone who has lived through the .com bubble the madness currently unfolding in the crypto space is just plain breathtaking.
  It is quite awe inspiring to see people make the exact same mistakes they made 17 years ago. Of course, todayâ€™s investors
  are likely different people who, for the most part, have not lived through the .com bubble.</p>

<p>Those of you who are looking to read more about the topic or learn some basics about cryptoassets can check the end of this
  blog post, where I am simply collecting some interesting links that I believe are worth a look.</p>

<strong>Before we start</strong>

<p>I need to establish some basic definitions. To me, there are three different kinds of Cryptoassets:</p>

<p>a) Cryptocurrencies := Cryptoassets that are mainly used to store value, speculate or transact on the blockchain. Examples
  are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dash as well as ZCash.</p>

<p>b) Platforms or true Utility token := Cryptoasstets that enable decentralized applications (DApps) or enable other token
  to trade on their blockchain. Examples would include Ethereum, Lisk, Blockstack or Tezos (when they launch)</p>

<p>c) Security token := any and all ICOs that are sold to investors so that they can speculate on the progress of a start up.
  This would include TenX, Monaco, Status and Iconomi amongst a host of others.</p>
